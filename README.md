# Password-Manager
so this is a Password Manager I make with Tkinter. I can save our daily password in it and if I want to search some password I saved it earlier it also show us that. I use Json file to save the data and also use exception handling for some Errors like if you try to enter blank or something it will so you some error message in a messagebox. I tried to make more user friendly by adding some real life scenario. I also add one generate button what will provide some randomize strong password with alphabets, nubers and symbols. I also did some test on it so that no errors occur overall it was a good project.
